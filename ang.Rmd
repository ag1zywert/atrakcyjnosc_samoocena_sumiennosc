#### PERSONALITY PROFILE (POSITIVE)

* Participant number: 47 

**Time and Place of Evaluation:**  Fall, 2014
**Methods used:**  Beck Personality Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Assessment, Sensitization Scale, Eysenck Trait Inventory, and the Relationship Orientation Assessment
Reason for referral: Research purposes.

##### **Evaluation:**

You are self-sufficient and do not have a strong need for other people to like you and admire you. You wisely tend to accept yourself as you are rather than be critical of yourself. You have an exceptional amount of unused energy, which you can easily learn to turn to your advantage.  While you may feel you have some personality weaknesses, your personality is very strong. Your sexual adjustment has presented far less than the usual amount of problems for you.  


While you may feel worrisome and insecure, you have a great deal of discipline and control on the inside. You seldom have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decisions or done the right thing. You may prefer a certain amount of change and variety but when necessary can work effectively and creatively even when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. 

You pride yourself on being an independent thinker and are open to new opinions and viewpoints. You are more capable than most of being quite frank and revealing yourself to others. Although you are generally extroverted, affable, and sociable; you also have the capacity to enjoy and fully utilize the time you have to yourself. Given your personality traits, there is a good chance that even your most ambitious aspirations are realistic.
